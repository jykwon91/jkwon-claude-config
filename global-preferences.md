## Global Software Engineering Preferences

### Code Quality
- Prefer simple, minimal solutions. Avoid over-engineering.
- Don't add abstractions, helpers, or utilities unless clearly necessary.
- Don't add comments unless the logic is non-obvious.
- Prefer editing existing code over creating new files.
- Write code for readability and maintainability first — optimise for the next developer reading it, not for cleverness.
- Never use hacks or workarounds — always prefer the cleaner, more elegant, and robust approach even if it takes more effort upfront.
- Don't duplicate code — extract repeated logic into a shared function or module rather than copying it.
- Always remove unused code, files, directories, imports, type exports, and stale references when making changes — don't leave dead code or orphaned references behind.

### Typing & Structure
- Always use strict typing. Avoid `any`, implicit types, or loose type definitions.
- Define one type, model, or interface per file — never group multiple type definitions in a single file.
- Keep types, constants, and configuration in dedicated directories — never define them inline in component, route, or service files.
- Separate configuration from code — keep environment-specific values, constants, and magic numbers in dedicated config or constants files, not inline.

### Architecture
- Modularize code by responsibility — each module, file, or function should have a single, well-defined purpose.
- Structure projects logically — group files by feature or domain, not by file type, so related code lives together.
- Prefer pure functions — functions with no side effects and deterministic output — unless state or side effects are required.
- Follow layered architecture — route/controller handlers should be thin wrappers that delegate to services; services contain business logic; repositories or data-access modules handle all database operations.
- Never import database or ORM primitives in route handlers — data access belongs in the service or repository layer.
- Extract data mapping and conversion logic into dedicated mapper modules — services orchestrate (load, decide, persist), mappers convert (raw data → model). Never duplicate model construction logic across multiple files.
- All imports belong at the top of the file — never inside functions or methods. If a circular import occurs, fix the architecture (break the cycle by restructuring modules), don't hide it with a lazy import.
- Before writing a custom solution, research whether a well-supported, well-maintained library already solves the problem. Suggest it as an option if it fits the exact requirement and doesn't significantly increase project overhead.

### Testing
- Always write unit tests alongside new code — strive for high coverage to protect against regressions and breaking changes.
- E2E tests are regression contracts — when a test fails, the code is broken, not the test. Fix the code to make the test pass. Never change a test just to satisfy broken code. Only update tests when feature requirements explicitly change.
- Always include E2E layout tests when adding new pages or modifying page layouts.

### Security
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys in source files — always use environment variables. Committing `.env` files with dev/dummy values is acceptable.
- Always validate field names against an explicit allowlist before applying dynamic updates (`setattr`, spread operators, etc.).

### UX Patterns
- Never define components inline or inside other components — always extract to separate files and import.
- Extract reusable UI components for any pattern repeated 3+ times — loading states, empty states, badges, cards.
- Use toast banners or non-intrusive notifications for error and success feedback — never use `alert()` or modal dialogs for operation results.
- Use skeleton loaders for page loading states — never show plain text like "Loading..." as a placeholder. Skeletons should mirror the layout of the loaded page to prevent layout shift.
- Always show a loading state on buttons immediately when clicked — don't wait for the API response to indicate progress.
- Always design UI components and pages with mobile-first responsiveness — ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px, layouts work on small screens, data tables have responsive column visibility or card alternatives, and interactive elements support touch events alongside mouse events.
- Never block the UI or API responsiveness with background work — offload long-running tasks so users can continue interacting with the application.
- Always provide visible feedback for every user action — show progress during operations, confirm success on completion, and display clear error messages on failure. Never leave the user wondering if something happened.

### Data Integrity
- Always inspect actual data before fixing bugs — query the database, check API responses, examine extraction output. Never assume what the data looks like.
- Never write fixes that drop, nullify, or silence valid data to avoid errors — if real data violates a constraint, fix the field mapping or the constraint, not the data. Data accuracy with the source is non-negotiable.
- Never introduce tech debt — if a solution requires TODO comments, temporary workarounds, known shortcuts, or "we'll fix this later" compromises, find the proper solution now or flag it as a blocker before proceeding.

### Refactoring
- Never refactor or rewrite components without preserving all existing functionality — inventory current features before rewriting, verify each feature works after, and get explicit confirmation before removing any feature.

### Workflow
- Always run the QA generator (`g-qa`) on first use in a new project to create a domain-specific QA agent tailored to that project's tech stack and data types. Then run the generated QA agent after implementing features to write and run tests.
- Always run the pre-commit review agent (`g-pre-commit`) before committing code changes to catch security issues, logic errors, and performance problems early.
- Always run design agents (UX, architecture, data) before implementing features — design agents are solutioning partners, not post-implementation reviewers.
- Always create a new git branch for each feature or PR — never push multiple unrelated changes to the same branch.
- Always merge existing feature branches to main before starting new work — check `git branch --no-merged main` at the start of every session and create PRs for any unmerged branches first.
- When a user corrects a mistake, don't just fix it — identify the root cause and create a systemic fix (test, preference, or workflow change) so the same mistake never reaches the user again.
